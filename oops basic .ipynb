This is called inheritance. In inheritance, there is a parent class and a child class. A child class inherits the properties and methods of the parent class.\\n\\nPolymorphism\\nPolymorphism simply means ‘many forms’. In Python this means that you can have one function or object that can be used in different ways. Let’s take an example of the addition operator (+); we can use it to add numbers, but we can also use it to concatenate strings.\\n\\nEncapsulation\\nEncapsulation is the process of making data private by wrapping data and its methods in a ‘capsule’ or unit, so that it can not be accessed or modified outside of that unit. This is achieved by making variables inside a class private. In Python we can make variables private by prefixing the variable name with a double underscore ‘__’. \\n\\nAbstraction\\nThe fourth pillar of OOP is Abstraction. Abstraction is about keeping the process simple by hiding unnecessary details from the user. Think of a car; the actual mechanism that keeps a car moving is hidden from the user. It is important to know how to drive a car; but it is not necessarily important to know what happens under the hood when you drive the car. Abstraction is about keeping the internal mechanics of the code hidden from the user. This reduces the complexity of the code, and ensures that we only concentrate on what is important.\\n'"
